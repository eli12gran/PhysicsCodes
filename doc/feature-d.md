# **Pendulum With Drag**

In a simple pendulum we have a periodic movement, that is, a movement that goes and returns. If we drew the force diagram of the movement, we would have something like this:

![](pendulum1.jpg)

When we talk about a simple pendulum, we mean that the angle {math}`\theta` is never greater than {math}`sin(15°)`, so this implies that {math}`sin(\theta) ≈ \theta` so we do not have a chaotic movement, as we will see a case later. If we wrote Newton's equations for this movement we would have:

```{math}
\sum F_{x} = -Tsen(\theta) = m \frac {d^2x}{dt^2}

\sum F_{y} = Tcos(\theta) - mg = m \frac {d^2y}{dt^2}
```

As we see here, we have two equations to solve a system with three unknowns. This system becomes very ineffective and complex to solve, so the easiest solution is to **translate the system to polar coordinates**. To take a good look at how the movement would be described in polar coordinates, let's look at the following image:

![](pendulum2.jpg)

If we were to write Newton's equations for this "new system", we would have:

```{math}
\sum F_{r} = T - mgcos(\theta) = m\frac {d^2 r}{dt^2}

\sum F_{\theta} = -mg sin(\theta) = m \frac {dv_{\theta}}{dt}
```

If we look at the image we can see that {math}`r` is the length of the string, so its derivative is a constant so it is {math}`0`. In addition, the equation of the sum of forces in {math}`\theta` can be described in a different way since the speed in this movement would be given by: {math}`r \frac {d\theta}{dt}`
then the equations are described as follows:

---
```{math}
T-mgcos(\theta) = 0

T = mgcos(\theta)

\frac {d^2\theta}{dt^2} = \frac {-g}{l} sen(\theta)
```
---

And these would be the equations that we must solve numerically.

In this paper, the pendulum equation will be solved in four cases:

1. Simple pendulum with Euler's method (this is  for {math}`\theta \leq 15°`)
2. Simple pendulum with the Euler-Cromer method (that is, for {math}`\theta \leq 15°`)
3. Friction Pendulum (for large {math}`\theta` values)


### **Simple Pendulum with Euler**

For this case:

```{math}
\frac {d^2\theta}{dt^2} = \frac {-g}{l} \theta
```

Numerically:

```{math}
\omega_{i+1} = \omega_{i} - Δt(\frac {g}{l} \theta_{i})
```

```{theta}
\theta_{i+1} = \theta_{i} + \omega_{i} Δt 
```

This is:

```
#Import Libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```
g = 9.8; theta = [0.1]; w = [0]; l = 1
time = np.linspace(0, 10, 200)

for i in range(len(time)-1):
  w.append(w[i] - g/l * theta[i] * time[1])
  theta.append(theta[i] + w[i] * time[1])

plt.plot(time, theta)
plt.grid("--")
plt.title("Pendulum With No Drag Euler Method")
plt.xlabel("time")
plt.ylabel("theta")
```

### **Simple Pendulum with Euler-Cromer**

We have the same case above but numerically it is as follows:

```{math}
\omega_{i+1} = \omega_{i} - Δt(\frac {g}{l} \theta)

\theta_{i+1} = \theta_{i} + Δt (\omega_{i+1})
```
The code is:

```
g = 9.8; thetacromer = [0.2]; wcromer = [0]; l = 1

for i in range(len(time)-1):
  wcromer.append(wcromer[i] - g/l * thetacromer[i] * time[1])
  thetacromer.append(thetacromer[i] + time[1]*(wcromer[i+1]))

plt.plot(time, thetacromer, color="orange")
plt.grid("--")
plt.title("Pendulum With No Drag Euler-Cromer")
plt.xlabel("time")
plt.ylabel("theta")
```

### **Pendulum with friction**

For this case we would have:

```{math}
\frac {d^2\theta}{dt^2} = -\frac {g}{l} sin(\theta)- \frac {b}{m} \frac {d\theta}{dt} 
```

Where {math}`\frac {b}{m}` is the coefficient {math}`\gamma` used in the previous codes. Since this equation is non-linear, what we will do is "take advantage" of the definition of angular frequency {math}`\omega` which is defined as the change of the angle with respect to time. So having it this way we can say that {math}`\omega = \frac {d\theta}{dt}`. So our equation would be in terms of {math}`\omega` and would look like this:

```{math}
\omega´ = -\frac {g}{l} sin(\theta)- \frac {b}{m} \omega
```

Now yes, we can use Euler-Cromer again to solve it, and the numerical equations are as follows:

```{math}
\omega_{i+1} = \omega_{i} + Δt(\frac {-g}{l} sin(\theta_{i}) - \gamma \omega_{i})

\theta_{i+1} = \omega_{i+1} + Δt(\theta_{i})
```

Since the idea is to observe several angles in a graph, we will create a function for this. It will receive as parameters a maximum time, a list of angles and the coefficient of viscosity, the latter is which is in the hands of the user to change. The dynamic viscosity of the air is quite low ({math}`0.018`), so it is recommended to set a slightly larger number to see how the movement stops.

The code is as follows:

```
def frictionPendulum(tiempo, angulos, dynamic_viscosity, dt=0.01, g=9.8, l=0.5):
  miu = dynamic_viscosity; m = 10; g = 9.8; R=5; #Constantes
  b = 6*np.pi*R*miu
  gamma = b/m
  t = np.arange(0, tiempo+dt, dt)
  w2=[0]
  for theta_ in angulos:
    theta = [theta_, theta_]
    for i in range(1, int(tiempo/dt)):
        w2.append(w2[i-1] + t[1] * (-g/l * np.sin(theta[i-1]) - gamma * w2[i-1]))
        theta.append(theta[i-1] + t[1]*w2[i])
    plt.plot(t, theta, label=f"angulo={theta_}")
  plt.legend(loc="best"); plt.grid("--"); plt.ylabel("theta"); plt.xlabel("time"); plt.title("Pendulum with Drag Euler Cromer"); plt.show()
  pass
```

Calling our finction and giving it some angles converted into radians:

```
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(9,6))
frictionPendulum(10, [90*np.pi/180, 45*np.pi/180, 50*np.pi/180, 80*np.pi/180], 0.097)
```
---
Now, with the purpose  of comparing the exact and analytical solutions, we solved the differential equation for **small angles** analitically which gave as a result:

```{math}
\theta(t)= \theta_{0} e^{-\gamma t/2} sin(\omega t + \phi)
```

It is important to let clear that this is a possible solution when:

```{math}
\omega = \sqrt{\frac {\gamma^2}{4} - \frac {g}{l}}
```

For large angles, the equation cannot be solved analytically since it is no longer linear ({math}`sin(\theta)` appears) in the second derivative of {math}`\theta`. So, the solution of this analytic remains:

```
gamma = 1; phi = 0; theta = [0]; amp=1; phi=0; g =9.8; l=1
time = np.arange(0, 10, 0.01)
w = np.sqrt( abs((gamma**2 / 4) - (g/l)))
for i in range(len(time)-1):
  theta.append(amp * np.exp(-gamma*time[i]/2) * np.sin(w*time[i] + phi))

plt.plot(time, theta)
plt.title("Exact Solution for Small Theta Values With Drag")
plt.grid("--"); plt.ylabel("theta"); plt.xlabel("time")

```
